How does merge sort work? Is this sorting algorithm very efficient or less efficient?,"It repeatedly divides the array into 2 halves, sorts them, then merges them. It’s very efficient",It cuts the array into 2 parts and each part is separately sorted. It’s very efficient,It swaps elements if they are in the wrong order starting from the first element of the array. It’s less efficient,It selects the smallest element from the array and swaps it with the element at the beginning. It’s less efficient,A
Give 1 example of a very efficient sorting algorithm and 1 example of a less efficient sorting algorithm. Explain why each of them are called that.,Insertion sort is very efficient and it selects the minimum. Selection sort is less efficient and it sorts the fastest of all the other sorting algorithms,Insertion sort is very efficient and it inserts. Bubble sort is less efficient and it bubbles up until the end.,"Merge sort is very efficient and it cuts down lists into sublists until each one has 1 item, then merges them. Selection sort is less efficient and selects the minimum",Quick sort is very efficient and it sorts faster than other sorting algorithms. Merge sort is less efficient and it inserts,C
Where in the array does binary search start? When does it work?,At the first element. When the array is unsorted,At the last element. When the array is sorted,At the middle element. When the array is sorted,At the middle element. When the array is unsorted,C
